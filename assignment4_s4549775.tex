\subsection{Target Audience}
You say that the target audience are mathematicians and computer scientists. I agree with that. Later you say that $\equiv$ and $mod$ are only understandable by computer scientists. This contradicts your earlier point. As far as I know both of these are mathematical symbols and don't have anything to do with Informatics per se.

Your reasoning (apart from that) is sound though, and I agree with your conclusion.

\subsection{Message}
You only discuss RSA being used as a signature algorithm but the article is also concerned with its use to establish public-key cryptosystems. It's a good idea to mention the "comparison" to traditional media. I am not sure if "comparison" is the right word though, as the article wants to take some properties of the old system an apply it to the new one.

\subsection{Effectiveness}
I agree that the abstract is too long and detailed, while the introduction is too short. The point about the "comparison" against traditional media applies here as well.

You did not include the paper you chose. We were supposed to do this. I was able to find the article with the link you provided after logging in; but the abstract and introduction are not labeled and I did not really know where they are.

At first I thought the gray text was the abstract but that does not appear to be the case, as this switches to the normal, black text mid-sentence.

All in all I was not able to give good feedback for this exercise because the article you chose does not appear to be a scientific article, but an article from a magazine. I could not apply the necessary structure to that article.

\subsection{Target Audience}
I fully agree with your conclusion what the target audience is; but you did not provide any reasoning for that conclusion. To me it's pretty clear because of all the acronyms used, etc. You should probably mention it anyway.

\subsection{Message}
I agree with the author's message you worked out. You wrote it down very concisely, but still mention all the relevant information. Very well done.

\subsection{Effectiveness}
Again, I agree that the abstract is way too detailed and contains to much information that distracts from the actually important content. However, ironically, this is also true for you answer. I think the whole second paragraph of your answer could have been reduced to 1 or 2 sentences.
